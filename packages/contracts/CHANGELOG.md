# @appliedblockchain/giano-contracts

## 3.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 42753c8: Make the paymaster's tenant roster enumerable on-chain, and add a client library for it.

  `GianoPaymaster` gains an append-only set of registered tenant ids and four views over it —
  `tenantCount`, `tenantIdAt`, `getTenantIds` and `getTenants(start, count)`, the last returning each
  id paired with its full accounting record. Previously the roster could only be reconstructed by
  replaying `TenantRegistered` logs, which meant no client could list tenants or compute
  `Σ balances` from view calls alone. The new field is appended to the ERC-7201 namespace, so the
  storage layout change is additive and upgrade-safe; the committed layout snapshot moves with it.

  `@appliedblockchain/giano-paymaster-sdk` is new: a viem client covering every read and write on the
  paymaster, with the signer injected by the caller so the package never handles key material. Writes
  are simulated before signing, so a missing role arrives as a typed error naming the role rather
  than a reverted transaction. It also carries the role catalogue, tenant-id conversion, and the
  deployment health checks `giano-doctor` runs, as a pure function of an overview. Ships with a
  narrated walkthrough (`pnpm paymaster:demo`) and a management CLI (`giano-paymaster`).

- 42753c8: First versions published to GitHub Packages.

  - contracts: committed `generated.ts` ABIs and `addresses.ts` per-chain address registry
    (`gianoAddresses`, `getGianoDeployment`, `ENTRYPOINT_V07_ADDRESS`); typechain-types dropped from
    the published surface; publish needs no solc or submodules.
  - connector: viem/wagmi/RainbowKit become peer dependencies (wagmi + RainbowKit optional); proper
    `exports` map with types for `.`, `./web` and `./node`; `/node` entry no longer imports
    RainbowKit; injectable `GianoLogger` replaces console noise.
