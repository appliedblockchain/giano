Require WebAuthn user verification (G4). The wallet contract in release v2 now rejects any passkey signature whose authenticator data lacks the UV flag, so presence alone (for example a security key used without its PIN) no longer authorises an operation or an ERC-1271 signature. `BaseCredentialInfo.userVerification` now accepts only `'required'`; `'preferred'` and `'discouraged'` are refused up front. wallet-api enforces the same rule at registration, sign-in and owner addition.
